  "summary": "Diff removes the wallpaper control from the Header and adds a mount-time localStorage cleanup for a wallpaper key, but wallpaper-related modules still exist and additional unrelated UI interactivity guard/CSS changes were introduced.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Disable applying and rendering a custom wallpaper background across the app layout, including clearing any previously persisted wallpaper in localStorage so older wallpapers do not continue to appear.",
      "reason": "The diff shows localStorage cleanup on mount, but does not provide clear evidence that wallpaper background layers (e.g., app-wallpaper/app-wallpaper-overlay elements) are removed from the rendered layout everywhere; App.tsx is truncated and other potential render locations are not shown.",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Clean up unused wallpaper-related frontend code and styles after the feature is removed (components, hooks, and CSS) to avoid dead code and unused Tailwind/CSS selectors.",
      "reason": "Wallpaper-related files are still present and were modified rather than removed; without their contents it is not evident that the wallpaper feature code paths were fully deleted or that these modules are no longer dead code.",
